We have set up a database with several layers of caching, where some data is stored on our own server and some data is stoped on the API server. We have created an object that contains a comparison between our two dining halls, and created a route so that the client-side can access it. We have two collections: one corresponding to foods and their ratings and one corresponding to historical comparison data. We created random numbers to populate our foods collection with votes.

Looking ahead, we want to implement upvoting and downvoting food item. This has proven difficult because we do not want to compromise database synchronicity for performance. We want to restrict the number of votes per person. We will most likely do this via cookies or localstorage. Finally, we want to start finalizing the look and function of the main page. We also need to start solidifying the mobile design.
